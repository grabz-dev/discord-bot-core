# discord-bot-core

discord-bot-core is my framework for a basic Discord bot that simplifies command creation and allows for modular creation of different bot features.

This project is designed for my own purposes and updated with new features as I need them, meaning it is not going to be fully feature complete and is therefore not designed for public use.
