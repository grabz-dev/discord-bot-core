# discord-bot-core

discord-bot-core is my framework for a basic Discord bot that simplifies command creation and allows for modular creation of different bot features. It is intended to be used as a Node package for Discord bots that extend it with features.

Prerequisites:
  * Node v16.13 or higher
  * MySQL 8

This project is designed for my own purposes and updated with new features as I need them, meaning it is not going to be fully feature complete and is therefore not inherently designed for public use.
